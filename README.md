## Overview

This system uses machine learning to predict which students are at risk of poor academic performance based on key indicators like attendance, assignment scores, GPA, and internal marks. The interactive dashboard provides educators with actionable insights to support student success.

**Key Highlights:**
- ✅ 98% prediction accuracy
- ✅ Processes 100,000+ student records
- ✅ Real-time risk predictions
- ✅ Modern gradient UI design
- ✅ Interactive data visualizations

##  Features

###  Dashboard
- Overview of total students, at-risk count, and model accuracy
- Risk distribution visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs)
- Department and subject-wise risk analysis
- Gender-based performance insights
- Feature analysis with box plots

### Risk Prediction
- Individual student risk assessment
- Interactive sliders for data input
- Real-time probability scoring
- Visual risk gauge (0-100 scale)
- Personalized intervention recommendations

### Student Search
- Search by student name or ID
- Filter by risk status (All/At Risk/Safe)
- View complete student profiles
- Export search results to CSV

### Model Performance
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Feature importance analysis
- Detailed classification report
- ROC-AUC score metrics

### Data Export
- Download full dataset (CSV)
- Export at-risk students only
- Export filtered search results

## Dataset Details

The system uses synthetically generated data with the following characteristics:

- **Total Records:** 100,000 students
- **Demographics:** Diverse Indian names (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh)
- **Departments:** Engineering, Science, Commerce, Arts
- **Subjects:** 8 different subjects
- **Data Precision:** 2 decimal places for realistic measurements
- **Outliers:** 10% abnormal data for robustness testing

### Sample Data
| Student ID | Name | Attendance % | Assignment Score | GPA | Internal Marks | Status |
|------------|------|--------------|------------------|-----|----------------|--------|
| STU000001 | Aarav Sharma | 78.53 | 72.84 | 3.21 | 68.47 | Safe ✅ |
| STU000002 | Fatima Khan | 23.47 | 27.93 | 1.23 | 29.48 | At Risk ⚠️ |
| STU000003 | Karthik Reddy | 85.17 | 89.62 | 3.68 | 81.29 | Safe ✅ |
